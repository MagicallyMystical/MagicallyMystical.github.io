        <h3>North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Formed</h3>
        <p>An alliance between various western-European nations and northern American nations, NATO is an organization that strives to keep peace throughout the world. During the Cold War, it was mainly a coalition of capitalist nations opposed to the Soviet Union.</p>

    <h2>1950</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Korean War</h3>
        <p>Korea had been divided into 2 zones for post-war occupation at the 38th parallel - the Soviets in the North and the US in the South. Before elections for a new government were held, the temporary government in each part became entrenched. Northern Communist Korean forces, backed by the USSR, moved across the line in June 1950 to forcibly reunify the peninsula. UN/US troops back a corrupt Southern government. China steps in to support the communist government in the North and the US continues back to the South. No end or permenant division has ever been declared, although in July 1953, an armistice was reached, dividing Korea once again at the 38th parallel. This was the first armed conflict of the Cold War, involving thousands of US and Soviet troops in a bid to dominate the Korean Peninsula.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Hydrogen Bomb Developed</h3>
        <p>Developed by the US, the hydrogen bomb is one of the most deadly weapons created to date. It's development was a prime example of the US's competition with the USSR with respect to military technology -- it's conceivable that the hydrogen bomb never would have been developed were it not for the cold war.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Formation of the Warsaw Pact</h3>
        <p>The Warsaw Pact was essentially the communist version of NATO -- it was an alliance between Russia and various Eastern-European states with communist governments. It lasted until 1991, near the end of the Cold War.</p>

    <h2>1957</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>First Intercontinential Ballistic (ICBM) Missle Fired</h3>
        <p>The development of the ICBM was an example of the technology race between the US and the USSR. The concept was created during World War II by Nazi Germany, and both the US and the USSR tried to create an ICBM during the Cold War. The USSR succeeded in creating the ICBM first, but their first launch ended with an unintended crash 250 miles from the launch site. On August 21st, 1957, the first successful test was completed. While the US had originally left the development of the ICBM for later, it was given a high priority once the USSR began testing thermonuclear weaponry in 1953. </p>

      <li>
        <h3>Launch of Sputnik</h3>
        <p>Sputnik was the first artificial satellite to be launched out of the Earth's atmosphere. Launched by the Soviets, its galvanized the US into action, leading to the US's commitment to it's space program (and the "space race"). It also led to improved science education in US schools, as it was decided that the Soviets wouldn't have been the first to launch a satellite into orbit had American youth been better educated.</p>

    <h2>1960</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>U-2 Spy Plane Incident</h3>
        <p>The American U2 spy plane was considered revolutionary at the time -- a spy plane with a maximum altitude of 70,000 feet, it could gather intelligence in all weather conditions, day and night. When the Russians shot one down with a surface-to-air missile and held its pilot prisoner for espionage, the US government was greatly humiliated. This worsened conditions between the US and the USSR.</p>

    <h2>1961</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Bay of Pigs Invasion</h3>
        <p>The Bay of Pigs was a failed invasion of Cuba by Cuban exiles (and sponsored by the US Central Intelligence Agency). A response to the increasingly-communist government led by Fidel Castro, the event humiliated the US government and eventually led to the Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
        <time>April 17, 1961</time>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Construction of the Berlin Wall Began</h3>
        <p>The Berlin Wall was a wall between East and West Berlin, dividing the capitalist (Western) half from the communist (Eastern) half. It lasted for almost 30 years, and was torn down in 1990.</p>
        <time>August 13, 1961</time>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Cuban Missile Crisis</h3>
        <p>The Cuban Missile Crisis, largely a response to the Bay of Pigs Invasion, was a political and military standoff between the US and the USSR-backed Cuba. After the Bay of Pigs incident, the USSR began to install nuclear-armed missiles in Cuban territory, prompting the US to begin a naval blockade. This standoff lasted 13 days, and ultimately ended with the Soviet Union agreeing to remove the missiles under the two conditions: the US would not invade Cuba and it would remove it's nuclear missiles from Turkey. This incident is the main reason why the US still has strained relations with Cuba today.</p>

      <li>
        <h3>U.S. Joined the Vietnam War</h3>
        <p>War between the communist Viet Minh (North Vietnamese) and capitalist South Vietnamese. The US began by only sending advisors to help the South Vietnamese, but began deploying troops in July of 1965. This was one of the "fronts" where the US was fighting communism, as the Viet Minh were backed by the People's Republic of China.</p>

    <h2>1989</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Fall of the Berlin Wall</h3>
        <p>After a series of radical political changes in the USSR and erosion of the Soviet Union's power in other eastern-European countries (such as Poland and Hungary), the East German government announced that free passage would be allowed between East and West Berlin for the first time in almost 30 years. This was a sign that the USSR was breaking up -- its grasp on its citizens was beginning to weaken.</p>
